    <p><b>meta tag:</b> While used in HTML, this tag defines the metadata of a HTML document. Metadata is data or information about data. This tag remains within <b>head</b> element.</p>

    <p><b>Viewport:</b> Viewport is the area that user sees in a webpage and by saying that we are telling the browser that wherever the user is watching (i.e. mobile, tab or laptop etc.) the visible area will be the total width of device screen which is told in the second part</p>

    <p><b>initial-scale=1:</b> defines the initial zoom when the webpage is loaded in a browser. This means 1 CSS pixel is equal to 1 viewport pixel. This helps when devices change orientation. Such as when someone view a webpage in portrait mode and then try to view it in landscape then without initial-scale=1 the zoom feature will be distorted and proportionate viewing will not work and <b>UX</b> will be hampered.</p>
